# Simulation Week - the idea.

There were plenty of situations when searching the internet I found something interesting and useful, but I don't save it to my web-browser bookmarks. As a result of that I cannot find it anymore. That is why, I decided to change my habit and save the links weekly here. Maybe, someone will find them useful too!

The name SIMWEEK is only a convention. I will put here all links which might be interesting from engineering-geek point of view.

# Finite Element Analysis

- Simcenter 3D allows user to compare the numerical and experiment results from modal analysis directly. Especially, the option to show the difference of the eigenshapes seems to be very useful! [<a href="https://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/3D-Simulation-Knowledge-Base/Correlating-Simulation-amp-Modal-Test-Results-with-Simcenter-3D/ta-p/445043" rel="nofollow">ART</a>]

- The Simufact Additive 3 allows user not only to show how 3D printing processes is going to look like, but it will also show the residual stresses in the printed item.

- The trends and predictions in simulation industry for 2018. I won't expect any revolution, but it would be really nice if someone manages to mix Machine Learning with Numerical Simulation.

- Some news from a simulation world in Digital Engineering magazine - issue January 2018. [<a href="http://read.nxtbook.com/peerless_media/digital_engineering/january_2018/" rel="nofollow">ART</a>]

# Computational Fluid Dynamics

- Very nice example of two-phase simulation of a jumping fish! [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFFpHh8slak" rel="nofollow">VID</a>]

- This post tries to show what is the difference between Navier-Stokes and Lattice-Boltzmann fluid mechanics modelling approach. [<a href="http://feaforall.com/creating-cfd-solver-lattice-boltzmann-method/" rel="nofollow">ART</a>]

- Do you remember the great Roberto Carlos goal in Brazil-France match? It was the Magnus effect which can be modelled using the Lattice-Boltzmann method. [<a href="https://info.simuleon.com/blog/xflow-cfd-demonstrating-the-magnus-effect" rel="nofollow">ART]

- The Palabos library is freely available for everyone who would like to do some CFD study using the Lattice-Bolltzmann (yes, I know it looks like the LBM is the main topic on this page). As you can see below, some nice-looking results can be achieved (the example is the results from acoustic analysis). The link attached will redirect you to the AskMeAnything on Reddit with one of the authors of Palabos.

# Engineering

- Maybe some day people will be able to 3D-print a human heart. Currently this artificial organ can resist up to 45 minutes - still great achievement! [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e276y5oSu2A" rel="nofollow">VID</a>]
