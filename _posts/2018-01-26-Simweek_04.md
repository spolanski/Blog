- I have heard once that turbulence is the greatest mistery of our time. I do agree with it and that's why I admire people who try to explore such tough topic. This article sheds some light on why it is so difficult to find a solution to Navier-Stokes equation [<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-makes-the-hardest-equations-in-physics-so-difficult-20180116/" rel="nofollow">ART</a>]

- Sometimes, I find a video which makes me thinking for another few hours… It is one of these videos. I still don't know where might be the limit of computer simulations [<a href="https://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Simcenter-Blog/High-fidelity-combustion-simulations-drive-down-emissions/ba-p/439617" rel="nofollow">ART</a>]

- New component of Bugatti is a result of topology optimisation and 3D printing. It doesn't look safe for me, but I don't have to worry - I wouldn't invest my money into new Chiron anyway… [<a href="http://www.3ders.org/articles/20180122-bugatti-develops-worlds-largest-3d-printed-titanium-brake-caliper.html" rel="nofollow">ART</a>]
