Skateboarding was one of my favourite sports when I was younger. It has changed my life so much that I even wrote a Bachelors Thesis about it. Looking back in time, I feel that the decision was a really good move. It was my first simulation project I had ever done myself, so it required to learn new things. Undoubtedly, having practical experience in skateboarding helped me when I was trying to understand results, but I needed to obtain them first.

I decided to present the simulation of skateboard in this very first blog as it is so nice example of situation when hobby meets engineering. Unfortunately, I cannot use the model I built for Bachelors Thesis purposes as it was created in software that I don't have access to. I created new one in Abaqus Student version which is available free of charge to students, educators, and researchers for personal and educational use - I believe the educational blog fits well to these requirements.

# Rectangular specimen experiment

Each numerical model needs to be calibrated with its' physical equivalent.

# Pressure test on skateboard
# 'Real' drop test
