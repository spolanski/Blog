Since my university time, I have been thinking about writing a blog where I could present topics involved with the numerical simulations field. The reason behind it is quite simple - there are so many learning materials everywhere and I donâ€™t want to search for them everytime I want to recall something. That is why I will try to post my notes from time to time.
